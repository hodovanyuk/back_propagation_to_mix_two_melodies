# back_propagation_to_mix_two_melodies
Machine learning project.


### How to start
- place in same dir with files 5 mp3 files.
- run test_play.m in matlab
- Rez.mp4 will be result of mix 4 and 5 mp3 file.

You shoul change '/' to '\' in test_play.m on Windows
You shoul change '\' to '/' in test_play.m on Mac/Linux

### What is inside

Use plain back propagation algoritgm to train  5*10 nodes neural network to mix two sounds in one. NN got two files on input and one on output to set nn weights.

There are several examples in repo:

- Rez_classic - train and mix Bach and Mozart;
- Rez_instrumental - train and mix some electr. samples;
- Rez_with_voice - train and mix samples with voice,
